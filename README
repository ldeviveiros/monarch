Monarch is the library for file I/O used by the Project 8 collaboration.

Building the library requires Google's Protocol Buffers library (available 
at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).  Follow the instructions 
in the included README file to install.

Monarch is installed using CMake (version 2.8 or better).
We recommend an out-of-source build:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
To configure the installation:
    cmake ..
The .. argument points to the top-level Monarch directory, in this case
assuming that the build is taking place in the "build" subdirectory.
ccmake, or cmake-gui may also be used, of course.

To build and install:
    make
    make install
    
The install prefix is specified by the CMake variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
The library, binaries, and header files will be installed in the 
lib, bin, and include subdirectories. The default install prefix is the
build directory.

Any CMake-based projects that will depend on Monarch can include 
the MonarchConfig.cmake file that is located in the build directory.
