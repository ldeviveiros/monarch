Monarch is the library for file I/O used by the Project 8 collaboration.
Building the library requires Google's Protocol Buffers library (available 
at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).  To build, install
protocol buffers, and then execute 

PROTOC=<path to bin/protoc> PBLIBDIR=<path to libprotobuf> make

For example, if protoc = /usr/bin/protoc and libprotobuf is located at
/usr/lib64/libprotobuf.so, then

PROTOC=/usr/bin/protoc PBLIBDIR=/usr/lib64 make

Will complete the build.

Once monarch builds, you can execute the test executable
by running ./monarch_test in the same directory.  It will run a series
of tests, including throughput tests.  On a 2012 Macbook Air, I measure
roughly 250MB/s write throughput.

A library, libmonarch.so, will also be created.  This is the library to
link code against.
