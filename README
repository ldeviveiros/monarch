Monarch is the library for file I/O used by the Project 8 collaboration.
Building the library requires Google's Protocol Buffers library (available 
at https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).  To build, install
protocol buffers, and then execute 

PBDIR=<path to bin/protoc and lib/libprotobuf> make

Where PBDIR is the base directory in which bin/protoc and lib/libprotobuf
are located.  Once monarch builds, you can execute the test executable
by running ./monarch_test in the same directory.  It will run a series
of tests, including throughput tests.  On a 2012 Macbook Air, I measure
roughly 250MB/s write throughput.
